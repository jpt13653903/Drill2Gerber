# Drill2Gerber

Drill2Gerber is a command-line tool to convert drill files to Gerber.

It implements a small subset of the Excellon drill format, but has been tested
successfully on drill files generated by FreePCB, PCAD, KiCad, Microchip, 
Mentor Graphics, Autodesk Circuits and Altium Designer.
